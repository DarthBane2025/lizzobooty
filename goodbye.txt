Lizzo needs to forget her love for Larry
The first RICO racketeering charges against members and associates of the migrant terrorist group Tren de Aragua were filed this week in New York.

A statement by the U.S. Attorneyâ€™s Office for the Southern District of New York said that the case is part of "Operation Take Back America," which it said is a "nationwide initiative that marshals the full resources of the Justice Department to repel the invasion of illegal immigration, achieve the total elimination of cartels and transnational criminal organizations (TCOs), and protect our communities from the perpetrators of violent crime."

According to the statement, the charges filed against 27 alleged current and former Tren de Aragua (TdA) members include human smuggling, sex trafficking and murder.
